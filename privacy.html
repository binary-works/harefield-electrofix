    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    
    <p>We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data in compliance with the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR) and the Data Protection Act 2018.</p>
    
    <h2>1. Data We Collect</h2>
    <p>This website does not collect any personal data through forms. Customers contact us directly via WhatsApp using the phone number provided on the site. Any information shared via WhatsApp is stored only in our WhatsApp app on a secure phone and email mailbox.</p>
    
    <h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>
    <p>We use contact information only to respond to enquiries about small electrical repairs (sockets, plugs, lighting fixtures) and manage communications. We retain certain client data for legal and tax compliance purposes, including possible checks by HMRC.</p>
    
    <h2>3. Lawful Basis for Processing</h2>

    </ul>
    
    <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>Your data is stored securely in password-protected WhatsApp on phone and email mailbox, accessible only to authorised personnel. Appropriate technical and organisational measures protect your personal data.</p>
    
    <h2>5. Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain personal data only as long as necessary to respond to enquiries or as required by law for tax purposes (typically at least 5-7 years for HMRC compliance). After this period, records will be deleted.</p>
    
    <h2>6. Third-party Services</h2>
    <p>This site may use privacy-respecting analytics (no cookies, no personal data collection) to measure traffic. We may link to generic third-party services in future but take no responsibility for their privacy practices.</p>
